Today I’m sharing all the newest information about our San Diego real estate markets.

As you may have heard recently, the market is broadly seeing a modest increase from last year to this year. We’re noticing open houses are exceedingly busy. In fact, we welcomed over 200 people at our last open house\! We’re seeing a lot of energy return to the market, and I foresee this will continue through the winter months as long as interest rates stay where they are.
