Are you thinking about building an ADU or granny flat on your property? Today I have Ian Scattergood with me to talk about the guidelines for San Diego.

Are you looking to build a granny flat or accessory unit on your property? Today we have Ian Scattergood, a permit pro, with us to discuss how to get a granny flat or accessory dwelling unit built (ADU) on your property in San Diego.

This has become a very popular topic in San Diego for many reasons. Some people want to rent out space for income on Airbnb or VRBO, while others simply want their guests to have a place to stay during their visits.

An accessory dwelling unit (ADU) is a second rentable unit on a single-family developed lot. There are some basic rules in San Diego for those people who want to build an ADU. The state requires a minimum size of 150 square feet and a maximum of 1,200 square feet. It must also have bathing facilities and cooking facilities, which can be a ¾ bath and a kitchenette.

Each jurisdiction can have either more restrictive or less restrictive guidelines than the state.

To get started, you can call Ian’s office and provide the address at which you are considering building the ADU. He will Google the location to decide if it is a prime candidate to move forward and then contact you about what he thinks. Based on your jurisdiction, he can provide the guidelines and can help you decide if you want to consider building. &nbsp;

Some people in San Diego may want to convert a current space, such as another garage or craft room, into a livable space. You can take an old garage, shed, or legally permitted granny flat and convert it into a unit as long as it abides by new fire & life safety codes. A new law provides relaxed setbacks and off-street parking guidelines.

You can contact Ian for more information about if your property qualifies at (619) 579-0088.

If you want to know more about the real estate market here in San Diego, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
