<br>Today we’re discussing the four massive mistakes we see home sellers make when it comes time to sell their home:

**1\. Assuming you will get top dollar**. If you assume you will receive top dollar for your home because your neighbor did, this isn’t necessarily the case. Every home is unique; whether it’s the finishes, the lot, the view, or the condition of the home, they all make a substantial difference in the value. Also, every home requires a slightly different technique to sell it, needs distinct marketing. The key to receiving top dollar for your home is knowing who your buyer is and knowing where to price it.

**2\. Assuming the price is everything**. Price is important, but it isn’t everything. Homes commonly sell for top dollar in the first two to four weeks. If not, they’re perhaps slightly overpriced. The price of the home needs to be just right. The margins in home pricing these days are razer thin. If a home is slightly overpriced, it can be on the market four or five months later.

**3\. Not using professional photography**. Professional photography in 2019 is essential. Not using professional photography is the first way to ensure your home fails to sell. Today people scroll Instagram and Facebook and buy items because the photography caught their eye. When people are scrolling their phones or tablets, we want your home to attract their attention.

**4\. Not addressing simple repairs or curb appeal**. Many times we walk into a home that is simply not ready to be sold. Prepping for sale could be as straightforward as a deep cleaning or fresh wood chips and flowers in the yard. Often we notice an old door handle is the first impression because it’s the first thing buyers see when they walk up to the house. Frequently, investing between $500 and $1000 can make a massive difference when it comes time to sell. We also see this with repairs: a few hundred dollars can make a huge difference.

Look at the big picture. No one wants to spend more money than necessary.
