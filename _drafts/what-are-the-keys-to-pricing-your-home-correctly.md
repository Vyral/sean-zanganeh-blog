<center>Pricing your home properly is one of the keys to getting it sold quickly and for top dollar. Here are a few reasons why.</center>

If you’re thinking of listing your home in the near future but aren’t quite sure how to price it in this changing market, we’ve got some great tips to share with you.&nbsp;

**At the beginning of this year, we had roughly 4,000 homes on the market.** At the peak of the summer market, we had somewhere between 7,500 and 8,000 homes. This is a large increase in inventory, which makes pricing your home that much more important.

To know if this increase of inventory makes a difference for you in your community, we have to look at comparable sales. When you are competing against multiple homes, you have to price it right in order to sell quickly and for top dollar.

If there are a lot of homes for sale in the area, can you be the most expensive home on the market? Maybe, maybe not. We like our clients to take a close look at the other homes for sale in their market so they can really compare the features and benefits of those homes to their own. Looking at the most recently sold homes in the area and their prices will assist you in finding a price that makes sense.

**Finally, marketing is of the utmost importance.** The quality of the agent you choose and the quality of their marketing plan will make the difference between you selling in a few weeks vs. selling in a few months. We focus on the marketing that helps you win in the shortest amount of time, while also pricing the home at a level that is attractive to you as a home seller.

If you have any more questions about pricing your home or about anything else related to real estate, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
