    Today's clients need today's servicesâ€¦ Sean is a firm believer in this
    practice and applies it everyday to his business. Working with buyers and
    sellers today is not how it was just a few short years ago. Reaching buyers
    when listing your home is crucial to the success of your homes sale and that
    is what Sean does best.


    Not only is he up to date with the current practices of negotiating
    distressed properties including short sales and preventing home owners from
    foreclosure, but his skills in detailed and specialized marking from condos
    for 1st time home buyers to connecting high end luxury homes with their new
    owners makes him ideal for your next move.


    His keen and effective techniques of utilizing the most powerful tool we
    have, the internet and the ability to stay well connected in the community
    is what is going to effectively sell your home.
