<br>The market has been hot for the last several months, and it will probably remain that way for a while. Today I want to share three tips to help you make the most of the market when it comes time for you to sell your home:

**1\. Don’t just declutter—deep clean, too**. Too many people think that they can simply box up some of their stuff and be good to go. I’m sure you’ve walked into a home that was decluttered but still felt dirty, and that’s what you want to avoid. The psychology of today’s buyers has changed quite a bit; they’re very cognizant of their environment when they walk through a home, even if they’re not touching things. Spending a few extra bucks to deep clean your house (or doing it yourself) will make a huge difference when receiving offers.

**2\. Perfect preparation makes for a perfect home sale**. Typically when we sit down with clients, they have between a couple of days and a couple of weeks of preparation needed to make sure the home is in a condition that people are excited about. We want to create the same kind of environment that new construction homes tend to have.

**3\. Hire a top-quality agent**. You need to work with an agent who will not only tell you the truth, but also guide you through the process so that you can close escrow and sell your house for the most money possible.

If you have questions or we can be of assistance to you in any way, please reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
