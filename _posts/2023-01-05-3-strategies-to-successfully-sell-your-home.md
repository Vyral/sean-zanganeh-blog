Now that the market has shifted, sellers have to be strategic if they want to sell their homes. To increase your chances of a successful home sale this selling season in the San Diego real estate market, here are the three most important things you need to consider:

**1\. Preparation.** A well prepared home has the highest probability of getting sold. This means when buyers walk up the house, all the finishing details have been taken care of. This may include making sure that there's fresh wood chips outside or that you changed the bulbs for the outdoor lighting. Simple details like these make buyers think that you care for your home.

**2\. Presentation.** To get the most amount of eyes on your home, you’ll need to work with a professional real estate agent who'll bring you the value with high-quality HD video and photo and distribute all of that into the market.

**3\. Price.** Prices are coming down a little bit, and there are three ways to price a home in this environment: One is to price at slightly above the market and negotiate, which we've found to be very ineffective today. Another way is to price it at market value and hope to get at market offers, which is a little bit more effective but not the best. An alternative way is to price the home slightly below the market, which has so far caused most people to take notice of the property. Being very conscious of pricing and knowing that one to three months from now the home price might be slightly lower than what it is currently is important when maximizing every possible dollar out of your home.
