Today I’m happy to be joined by a special guest, Todd Pianin of RPM Mortgage, to have a discussion about millennial homebuyers in the San Diego market. Todd has some awesome lending tips that will help any millennial who is looking to buy their first home become competitive in the market.

**Many millennials grew up during the 2007 credit crisis.** Therefore, a lot of them only deal with cash and don't have credit cards. If you’re a millennial that doesn’t have a credit card but wants to buy a house, you should know that you’ll need to have at least three different cards in order to purchase one. It’s important that you start building your credit now, especially if homeownership is in your future plans.

**One other big problem we’ve run into with millennials is a lack of rental history.** If you’re in a situation where you’re living with a friend and renting a room from them, you should ask to get added to the lease. If you’ve been out of college for a few years and don’t have any rental history, it’s pretty hard to get qualified for a mortgage.

If you do have all of your ducks in a row, it gives you a huge advantage in the marketplace. Inventory is so tight now in San Diego and there’s talk of even less inventory in the future. **By having good credit and a solid rental history, Todd and his team can issue you an advanced approval in order to get your fully approved&nbsp;**(subject to appraisal, escrow, and title). This will allow you to close on a home in just 14 days, which is much quicker than the average buyer.

If you’re ready to start the pre-approval process or you just have any questions about credit or mortgages in general, give Todd a call at (858) 775-8958 or send an email over to Tpianin@rpm-mtg.com. If you have any other questions for us about the San Diego real estate market, don’t hesitate to reach out anytime. We look forward to hearing from you soon!
