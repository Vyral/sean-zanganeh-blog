If you’re struggling to find a home in the San Diego area, you’re not alone. Inventory has been overwhelmingly low, meaning that tons of buyers are competing over a small supply of properties. Many clients have been wondering why there are so few homes available, which is why we’re covering the top three reasons why San Diego and the rest of the country are experiencing an inventory shortage. **Here’s what’s happening:**

**1\. The COVID-19 pandemic:** In the past year, many would-be sellers have decided to wait on listing their homes until the pandemic has passed. Whether they’re immunocompromised or simply uncomfortable putting their homes on the market, fewer people are listing properties. This is the case in San Diego, and high demand from buyers means that inventory is at record-low levels.

**2\. Low interest rates:** Many people who were thinking of downsizing or moving laterally decided it would make more sense to take advantage of low interest rates, refinance their homes, and come out with a cheaper monthly payment. This is especially true for baby boomers, who hold the largest share of real estate; they’re able to wait longer to move because they now have more options and can better afford payments.

**3\. Longer life expectancy:** Baby boomers are also enjoying longer, healthier, and more functional lives. They’re also able to stay near their kids and grandchildren instead of moving to less expensive areas. In the past, older adults would typically be downsizing in their 60s and 70s, so this has locked down a lot of real estate. On top of this, San Diego isn’t able to have a lot of single-story homes, so this creates even more competition for the ones that are available.
