&nbsp;

If you’ve been thinking of selling your home this year but fear it may be too late, think again. The home-selling season is far from over. **In fact, selling later in the year in 2019 may actually work to your advantage**.

Typically in San Diego, the peak of the market is usually around mid-to-late June—but because of the (comparatively) high interest rates we saw at the end of 2018 and the excess inventory that marked the beginning of 2019, many people decided to hold off on making a move. This lack of activity was likely also due to pre-election jitters, as studies show that the real estate market tends to slow when a presidential election is on the horizon.

However, now that interest rates are at all-time lows, buyer demand has really ramped up. Many sellers have also taken this opportunity to relist properties that failed to sell earlier in the year. We haven’t seen this kind of late-year resurgence for some time.

**The bottom line is that anyone thinking of selling should think about entering the market soon**. Current conditions will likely help you to sell quickly and for top dollar, but they won’t last forever.
