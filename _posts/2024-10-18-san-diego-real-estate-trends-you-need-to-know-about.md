The San Diego real estate market is constantly evolving, and it’s more important than ever to stay updated on the latest trends. Whether you’re buying, selling, or just curious about the market, here’s what’s hot and what’s not in San Diego real estate today:

**Hot: remodeled homes.** Buyers are gravitating toward homes that have been remodeled. With rising labor and material costs, we're seeing that people would rather overpay for a renovated house than buy one at a slight discount.

**Hot: pricing trends.** Homes priced under $2 million are in high demand, while those in the $2 to $4.5 million range are experiencing some cooling. Buyers at the higher end are becoming more selective, preferring homes that are pristine and move-in ready. To stand out, higher-priced homes must be spotless and turnkey.

**Not hot: homes needing repairs.** Today’s buyers have little patience for homes requiring even small repairs. Simple fixes, like repainting a door or replacing a light fixture, can overwhelm potential buyers. This is especially true when paired with premium prices and high interest rates already affecting the San Diego market. Buyers value homes that are ready to move into without needing contractors.

**Not hot: buyers falling out of escrow.** One of the biggest challenges sellers face is buyers falling out of escrow, particularly due to inspections. While appraisals aren’t causing issues thanks to strong comparable sales, inspections are leading many buyers to back out. Homes that re-enter the market after falling out of escrow often struggle to regain momentum.

It’s tempting to relist your home at the previously agreed-upon price, but this could backfire. Instead, it’s better to relist at the original price. The initial price was designed to attract buyers and create demand. Relisting at a higher price only reflects the interest of one buyer and can lead to further price reductions down the line.
