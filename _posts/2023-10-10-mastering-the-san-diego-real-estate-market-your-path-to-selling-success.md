Are you considering making a move in the near future and wondering what to do with your current home? Many homeowners in San Diego, including me, find ourselves in this situation. Today, I want to share some valuable tips and tricks I've learned to help me get the most out of my home sale in the competitive San Diego real estate market.

One thing I've realized is **the importance of preparing a home before putting it on the market.** In my experience, there's almost always something that needs to be done to make it more appealing to potential buyers. It could be as simple as repainting the front door or changing a light fixture, or it might involve more substantial renovations to maximize my home's value.

A Home Audit Consultation is a service provided by my team to help homeowners determine what improvements are necessary to increase their home's resale value. The consultation typically takes between 15 and 30 minutes and involves a walk-through of your property.

**During this inspection, my team and I will identify any potential issues that could affect the sale of my home.** It could be a malfunctioning system, the need for a fresh coat of paint, outdated furniture that needs removal, or even landscaping improvements.
