Are you struggling to find a home here in San Diego County?&nbsp;

San Diego is in an inventory crisis right now. There are simply more buyers than there are available homes. So when a property does get listed, it receives a lot of attention.&nbsp;

Today, I’ve got three tips and tricks for helping you win out in our local real estate market:

**1. Work with an active agent or team.** Who you work with really does matter. You need to be working with a busy agent or team who is in touch with the current market. My team and I are always dedicated to searching out and following up on deals. When you work with us, we can offer you valuable inside knowledge on how to secure a property.&nbsp;

**2. Find an agent that is constantly working to find new properties.** Professionals who keep a constant eye on the market are going to help you immensely when it comes to finding the right home. Your chances will be even better if an agent can bring you a property that few people know about yet. The less competition a home sees, the better your chances are.&nbsp;

**3. Make sure you find out about off-market properties.** Don’t forget to check out properties that were listed a few years ago and have been recently relisted. These homes could present you with some unique opportunities.
