I get asked by a lot of young professionals about the benefits of home buying. They want to know if they should continue renting or just suck it up and buy a home.&nbsp;

**My initial response to them is that it depends. We’ve got to take a look at your goals, your income, and your debt, and everything else that goes along with buying a home**.

Generally, the average rental rate for a 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment is over $2,100 in San Diego. That’s a lot to be shelling out in rent.

Right now, with that same $2,100 going toward a mortgage payment, you could get a 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom condo here in the city in the mid $400,000 price range and still keep the same monthly cost.

**Another benefit of buying a home is that you can capture back your interest rate deduction when you file your taxes each year.&nbsp;**You can’t do that with rent.&nbsp;

Buying isn’t for everybody, but we can walk you through the options to make sure you make a decision that best fits your lifestyle and your needs here in San Diego.

If you have any questions for me or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help out.
