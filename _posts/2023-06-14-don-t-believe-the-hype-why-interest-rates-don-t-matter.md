Here’s the truth about interest rates: They don’t matter. I know that may sound odd, but hear me out. **The truth is that most homeowners refinance their mortgages within one to three years of purchasing their houses.&nbsp;**

In a market like ours, when interest rates are constantly fluctuating, it doesn’t make sense to avoid buying a house due to rates. No one knows where rates will be in a few years, but most experts agree that they will likely decrease. That means you can buy now and simply refinance in a few years.&nbsp;

**As long as you can afford the payment today, it doesn’t make sense to avoid purchasing a home you love.** If you have questions about this or any other topic, please call or email me. I’d love to hear from you!
