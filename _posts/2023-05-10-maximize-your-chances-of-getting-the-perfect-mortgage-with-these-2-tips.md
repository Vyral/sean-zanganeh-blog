Are you starting the process of shopping for a home mortgage so you can buy your next home? If you are, there are two important things you should know.

The first one is how to interview mortgage lenders. When it comes to this, it’s all about comfortability. **Make sure you have someone who will help lead you through the process so you don't have to constantly call and ask questions.** You want someone who is responsive and will help you through the whole process.&nbsp;

Next, you need to find out how much you can afford and the process involved. The simple rule of thumb is that **one-third of your gross monthly income is about the monthly payment you can afford.**

If you are looking for more tips and tricks on how to win in the real estate market, or have any questions about your buying and selling plans, call or email me. I’m always happy to help.
