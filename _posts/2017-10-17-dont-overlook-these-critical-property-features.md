There’s a lot to think about whenever you’re taking steps to purchase your next home. Of course, one of the first things to do is to sync up with a great real estate agent who’s really got your back.

Even so, there are a couple of things you shouldn’t overlook in your transaction. Even with the help of an agent, you want to pay close attention to certain aspects, yourself.

First, pay attention to the neighborhood. Typically speaking, you’ll visit properties with your real estate agent around a pretty consistent time of day. My team and I personally recommend revisiting any property you’re interested in at different times, to get a true feel for the community and know exactly what you’re getting.

Next, ask yourself what your commute will be like. **Your lifestyle should be a key consideration in your decision on whether to buy a certain home.&nbsp;**Whether you want to be close to work, to school, to family, or to a lot of restaurants, it’s important to know how far you’re going to need to travel.

Also, be sure to look into the rules of the community. A lot of communities in our area have homeowners associations or CC&Rs (Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions) that may impact things like the colors you can paint your home, what you can park in front of your house, and what kinds of pets are allowed.

Another thing people sometimes forget is to critically consider the bedroom-to-bathroom ratio. **Think realistically about how much space you and your family are going to need.&nbsp;**Even something that may work for you now may not work in the future if you plan on growing your family. Before deciding on a home, really think about what makes sense for you.

You should also make sure to change your HVAC systems. A lot of property in San Diego has septic systems, solar systems, wells, and other features. Look into what maintenance is going to cost you.

Another question to ask yourself is if you’re okay with features that can’t be changed. **Things like location, lot size, and the floor plan are all features you’re going to have to live with for however long you stay.&nbsp;**Make sure you’re happy with them.

Also think about your resale value. You need to have a clear understanding of what it costs to own the home, what the home’s potential value is, and what rents are going for in the neighborhood in case you ever decide to rent the property out.

Finally, decide if a given property will realistically be sufficient for you and your family’s growth in a long-term sense. Depending on how long you want to stay on a property, you really need to think about this factor. **My team and I often see people try to squeeze into a home that is too small, simply because it fits their budget.&nbsp;**Don’t make this same mistake. Make sure a property matches your long-term goals.
