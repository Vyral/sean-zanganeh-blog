Downtown San Diego is one of the great landmarks of the west coast, but the last few years have been rough. The pandemic shut down the city’s vibrant social scene, and things have been slow to open back up. Now that more people are vaccinated and heading back to work, are things starting to come back?

As of late November 2021, **a lot has changed in the downtown condo market.** We have fewer than 90 units for sale and over 140 in escrow. The rest of the San Diego housing market increased 30% during the pandemic, and it looks like downtown is just starting to catch up.

Homes are entering escrow this year 65% faster than last year. On top of that, closed units are up 68%. One thing I’ve noticed is that the areas in development have a lot more clarity. New buildings are coming in, and people are feeling optimistic.&nbsp;

**What does this mean for the future?** It looks like downtown prices are only going up, and inventory is only decreasing. People from all over the country are buying property here, so if you want to get in on the action, you better act fast.&nbsp;
