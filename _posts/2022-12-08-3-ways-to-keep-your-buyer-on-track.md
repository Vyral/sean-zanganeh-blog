Are you considering selling your home but are worried that the buyer might cancel escrow and leave you high and dry? This is challenging, but we can help you work to avoid it. With cancellations on the rise due to the shifting market, it is increasingly important that you know our tips to make sure that your deal gets to the finish line:

**1\. Prepare your home properly.** With every property that we help list, we walk through as a team and with the owner to make sure that all of the important issues are addressed. You don’t want your buyer to be concerned about problems, so fix them beforehand and be transparent. The initial preparation is imperative.&nbsp;

**2\. Disclose any issues.** There’s something wrong with every house, so don’t get discouraged. It is important that you don’t get so worried about the issues that you try to hide them. You don’t want to surprise your buyers since lazy disclosures can scare them away or cause them to question things. Be as transparent and forthcoming as possible.&nbsp;

**3\. Find the costs and solutions to problems.** We have noticed that often, buyers lack visualization or don’t understand the true cost of certain projects. Therefore, we find out the numbers and share them with the buyer. Frequently, it costs less to fix things than they think it will.&nbsp;

These are just a few tips to make sure that your escrow is smooth. If you have any questions or want more help, don’t hesitate to reach out\! You can call or email us anytime.&nbsp;
