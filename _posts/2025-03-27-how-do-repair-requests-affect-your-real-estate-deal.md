A repair request is an important step in a real estate deal. When a buyer enters escrow, inspections take place to check the home’s condition. These usually include physical, drain, termite, and sewer inspections. The goal is to find any issues that need attention.

The more problems discovered, the bigger the request for repairs can be. If a home already looks worn down, major repairs are expected. However, conflicts happen when a home seems fine at first but inspections reveal unexpected problems. This is where negotiations can get tricky.

**Why honesty matters.** Sellers who are honest about their home’s condition give buyers more confidence. After inspections, buyers may find issues like a bad sewer line, termites, or plumbing leaks. They can submit a request for repairs, focusing on safety, structure, or mechanical problems rather than cosmetic fixes.

The buyer’s agent and seller’s agent negotiate the request. Buyers may ask for repairs, financial credit, or both. Sellers can agree to all, some, or none of the requests. In California, homes are sold “as is,” so sellers don’t have to make repairs.

**How a repair request works**. The process is simple. A repair request is a short document, sometimes just a basic text file. Negotiations go back and forth until both sides reach an agreement. Having an agent who understands repair costs can make this process much easier.

If the seller agrees to repairs, they usually wait until all contingencies are removed before starting the work. This way, the buyer is fully committed before the seller spends money. While straightforward, this step is one of the most technical parts of a real estate deal and often causes transactions to fall apart.

For buyers and sellers, working with a knowledgeable real estate professional and trusted inspectors can help ensure a smooth transaction. If you have questions or need guidance, please reach out.
