<center><em>Our market has seen an increase in buyer demand for a few reasons.</em></center>

<br>The San Diego real estate market is hot, but where are all these buyers coming from? **The majority of them are move-up buyers; that’s the main market today**. People are moving out of townhomes and condos and looking for more space. We’re also seeing many people move here from comparatively dense cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles to find more space.

Some of the reasons they’re moving here are that our weather is excellent, we have the lifestyle people want, we have beaches, and we have housing that’s a little more affordable than other similar areas. We’re also seeing people leaving states with colder weather, where they know they’ll be working from home for a while. For those who know they aren’t going back into the office anytime soon, it’s the perfect time to move here to San Diego.
