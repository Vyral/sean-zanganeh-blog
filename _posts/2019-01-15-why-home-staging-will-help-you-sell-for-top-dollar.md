<center><em>Staging a home is important, and here&rsquo;s how to do it.</em></center>

&nbsp;

We’re here today at the **BlueGrape Staging** warehouse facility, where they have all kinds of amazing things that are used to help homes come to life. We’re joined by owner and design expert **Pramiti Bhargava**, who will help us understand why home staging is so important for making a top-dollar sale.

Every home needs to be presented correctly, whether it’s occupied or vacant. Every buyer who walks in wants to have a connection with the house before they make an offer—**they want to see themselves living there**. You need to depersonalize your home to give a blank slate to potential buyers. For example, pictures of your family can distract buyers from viewing the actual features of a home.

Sometimes, homes don’t have the correct furniture setup. **There are two important things to consider: layout and scale**. A buyer needs to walk into a certain flow of traffic, but furniture can detract from this. A huge sectional can make a room seem half its size, but buyers want a home that seems big and open. Also, out-of-date furniture can make your home seem, well, out of date. You’re selling to today’s buyers—not buyers in the 1960s.

Updating your decor and being on-trend helps your home fetch the best price. When people see lighter, neutral furniture, they can better appreciate the character and strength of the house. After all, they aren’t buying the furniture; they’re buying the house. **Creating a consistent design from room to room is a good way to wow buyers**.

As we’re seeing more inventory in our market, it’s more important than ever to make sure your home is properly staged. These tips will help you stand out from the crowd and ensure you sell your home for top dollar.
