What is a contingent buyer? This is someone who is looking to buy their next home while still having to sell their current home. In today’s marketplace, this is one of the hottest topics that we’re running into. We have a couple of tips on how to plan your next move.

1.&nbsp;**Be very clear on your goals.** What are you looking to achieve? In our first consultation, we will sit down with you and get all the information about exactly what you’re looking for so we can find the home that fits your needs.&nbsp;

2.&nbsp;**Prep your home before listing.** We want to make sure that your home is prepped and ready to go before you list it. That means you’re going to want to declutter and stage your home before we list so that when you move, it’s a steady transition from the old home to the new one.

**You also need to get out there and look at some homes**. What we do with each one of our clients is look at homes prior to putting their home on the market. You need to see what’s out there and see what’s going to fit for your family and their needs.&nbsp;

3.&nbsp;**Have the same agent represent you on both properties**. Not only will it save you some money in the long run, but because you’re dealing with two transactions, having the same agent to take you through the entire process will remove some of the hassle. That way you have the same agent who understands your needs and will be able to act in accordance with those needs.

4.&nbsp;**Take a look at time frames**. Time frames are important because when you accept an offer on your house or get an offer accepted on your next house, you want to make sure that you don’t feel rushed during the moving process.&nbsp;

These are just a couple of tips to help our clients win in the contingent market today. If you have any questions about this topic or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please give us a call. We look forward to working with you!
