If you’re looking to add tens of thousands of dollars of value to your home this year, there are a couple of key things you can do. While these may be some big-ticket items that you’ll need to purchase, your investment will bring fantastic returns in the future.

Since the pandemic began, we’ve seen pools and backyards explode in popularity. Everyone wants a place where they can relax, spread out, and entertain guests safely, so many clients have been investing in their outdoor spaces. **Those who have added pools, which could cost $50,000 to $100,000, are often getting back $150,000 or more on their investment when they sell.** However, not all homes will gain value when a pool is added; in some cases, you might get a better return if you simply move without pouring money into your property. Either way, we always invite people to reach out to us so we can weigh the options together.

**Studio sheds, or accessory dwelling units (ADUs), are also becoming extremely popular.** Some people believe adding one would be a daunting task, but it’s actually quite easy. Some websites even have prefabricated options that you’re able to choose from. San Diego also has pre-approved plans homeowners can purchase to add ADUs to their property. Homeowners can use this as a way to create secondary income through a rental, or have a private place where relatives can stay. It gives people a lot of flexibility, and homebuyers are flocking to listings that include these units.
