If you’re a buyer who’s thinking about waiting until after the holidays to get into the market, you might want to think again. Today I want to talk to you about why I call this time of year “opportunity season”.&nbsp;

What I mean by opportunity season is that **people who need to buy and sell homes during this time of year are highly motivated.** Sellers don’t typically put their homes on the market during the holiday season unless they really need to sell. They may be willing to cut you a great deal just so that they can get everything settled before the end of the year.&nbsp;

**But what about the other buyers?** Everyone knows competition has been crazy this year, but a lot of buyers are sitting this window of opportunity out because they don’t think there are any great deals. Sellers tend to be more flexible about things like the closing date this time of year, so now could be the time to find that deal you’ve been looking for.

If you’ve been frustrated by the seller’s market over the last year, now may be the time to jump back in. If you have any questions about today’s video, please feel free to reach out via phone or email. I am always willing to talk.
