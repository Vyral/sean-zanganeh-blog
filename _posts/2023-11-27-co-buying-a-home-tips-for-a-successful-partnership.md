Buying a home with a friend in San Diego can be an appealing but complex venture. As someone who understands the intricacies of one of Southern California's most expensive housing markets, I want to share some essential tips and precautions for those considering this step.

**1\. Discuss agreements and disagreements.** It's crucial to talk about how you'll handle disagreements, whether they're about home aesthetics, renovations, or maintenance. Agreeing on these aspects beforehand can prevent conflicts later on.

**2\. Address financial concerns.** Finances can be tricky, especially if one party is less financially secure than the other. Discuss scenarios like job loss, relocation, or the need for a new tenant. It’s also vital to plan for unexpected expenses, such as major repairs not covered by insurance.

**3\. Plan for future changes.** Consider what would happen if one of you wants to sell or can no longer use the property. Preparing for these possibilities is crucial to ensure a smooth process if circumstances change.

**4\. Legal agreements: The Property Prenup.** I recommend drafting a ‘property prenup’ – a legally binding agreement that outlines the ownership terms, responsibilities, and what happens in various scenarios. This could be a Tenant in Common agreement or a joint venture (JV) or LLC setup, which provides a framework for making decisions and adapting to changes.

**5\. Seek professional advice.** Invest in consulting with a real estate attorney who specializes in drafting such contracts. This step is crucial to prevent potentially disastrous outcomes if things don't go as planned. Additionally, consulting a CPA for tax implications is wise.
