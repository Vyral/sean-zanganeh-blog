Many of my clients want to know whether it’s better to buy a fixer-upper or a turnkey home in the San Diego market. These buyers are usually looking to move up or are buying their first home and are nervous about making the wrong real estate decision.

Whenever I’m asked this question, **I always recommend they buy a home that is 80% to 90% finished.** They can then add their personal touches such as repainting, changing the flooring, and other light upgrades to complete the property. This typically makes the transition so much easier and faster since not everyone has the time and money to spend on these improvements.

If you need more help on this or have any real estate concerns, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’m always happy to help\!
