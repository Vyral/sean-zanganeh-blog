I get asked all the time what sellers should do to get their homes ready for the market. While there are many things that you should do, today, I want to share a few home renovations you should definitely avoid.&nbsp;

**First of all, wallpaper is out**. Don’t add wallpaper to your home unless you’re in a very selective, custom home or we’ve had some designers come in. If that’s not the case, throwing up some Home Depot wallpaper is not the way to go.&nbsp;

Secondly, keep the light fixtures simple. People don’t find a lot of value in extremely lavish light fixtures, especially in the middle price points. Instead of getting a lavish light fixture, stick with something clean and simple.&nbsp;

The next thing to pay attention to is flooring. In high traffic areas, it’s common for older homes to have carpet in the hallway, living room, or dining room. Buyers do not want you to replace that flooring with more carpet. Instead, consider laminate flooring, inexpensive tile, or hardwood floors. There are a lot of entry level hardwoods that competes with carpet pricing that you could install in a day or two and will look amazing.&nbsp;

**Although you should paint your home, you should avoid bold colors**. Stick to neutral paint colors instead. Bold reds, purples, and blues are a little too dark and a little too specific to your taste. Buyers want something a little more neutral and calming.&nbsp;

Finally, consider skipping the swimming pool. Today, there is a big debate about water conservation here in California and whether or not it’s smart to put in a pool. How do you pay for it? Is it on solar? As a result, a lot of buyers are more hesitant about having a private pool. In fact, most would be happy with a community pool, which a lot of neighborhoods already have.&nbsp;

Avoid these home renovations and you will have a successful home sale. If you have any other questions about preparing your home for the market or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
