As you know, **Valentine’s Day is coming up, so we wanted to help those of you who are still struggling to figure out what to do with a few recommendations.**

As far as restaurants go, Veladora over at Rancho Valencia, The Market in Del Mar, and Eddie V’s in La Jolla are a couple of our favorites.

If you’re looking to do something a little more outside of the box, consider going to a comedy club or taking a gondola ride down the shores in Coronado. You could also head to The Lot in La Jolla or Point Loma or Synapolis in Del Mar in La Costa to watch your favorite move with cocktails, a full bar, a restaurant, desserts, and more.

If you are looking to buy or sell a home, or if you have any other real estate questions, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. We would be happy to help!
