<center><em>I have some important news to share with future home sellers.</em></center>

<br>One of the main concerns we’re hearing from sellers right now is the uncertainty of whether or not there are buyers out looking for homes. I’m here to tell you that buyers are definitely out looking in our market right now.

**Although things are operating a little differently than they were before the pandemic, business is still being done nonetheless**. After a huge dropoff in showings back in March and April, we’re back to seeing a normal level of activity in our market.
