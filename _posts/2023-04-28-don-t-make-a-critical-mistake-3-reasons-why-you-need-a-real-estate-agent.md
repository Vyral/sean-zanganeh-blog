Real estate experts bring a lot to the table, or at least we think they do. They guide you through what can be a pretty difficult situation, but some people strongly disagree. Today, we’re going to go over three reasons why you should hire a real estate or mortgage professional:

**1\. Things can and will go wrong.** Whether or not you hire an expert, the chances of you having a totally smooth transaction are very low. When negotiations stall or a feature about the house becomes a hang-up, your experienced professional can help you navigate the situation.&nbsp;

**2\. Your family friend probably won’t cut it.** Many people end up choosing someone they know personally as their agent who just got their license as a hobby a few months ago. The truth is that these people aren’t really reliable experts since they don’t have much experience. If you want to ensure you have a good transaction, you need to work with someone who has been in your situation hundreds of times.&nbsp;

**3\. People who don’t work with agents usually overpay.** If you’re buying a home and are relying on the listing agent to give you accurate information, you might be in for a bad time. The truth is that your seller hired that agent for the same reason you should hire one: They want to get the best deal possible. Get your own representation and protect your interests.
