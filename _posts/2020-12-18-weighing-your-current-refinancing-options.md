<center><em>Should you refinance now or wait for lower rates? Here&rsquo;s my advice.</em></center>

<br>With interest rates as low as they are, a lot of our clients have been reaching out to ask if they should refinance. These are the lowest rates that we’ve ever seen, with some of our clients locking in rates below 2%. We know that the Federal Reserve has gone on record saying they won’t increase rates anytime soon, but should you wait? Well, on one hand, we don’t know what additional costs might be introduced by lenders down the road, but we do know that **right now you can lock in a low interest rate** and get the best possible financing for your home.

If you have any other questions for me or would like to get connected with a great local lender, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
