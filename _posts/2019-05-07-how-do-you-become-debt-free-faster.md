How can you pay down your mortgage faster so that you can own your home debt-free? Today I’ll share two great ideas you should look into when it comes time to purchase your next home or refinance your current one:

**1\. Make one extra payment every year**. Did you know that by making one extra payment on your 30-year mortgage every single year, you could actually pay off your mortgage seven years faster? If you do this, you’ll also end up paying a lot less in interest over that time.

**2\. Make sure you know the difference between a 30-year mortgage and a 15-year mortgage**. Many will typically go for a 30-year mortgage because they think they’ll be in the house long-term, but did you know that on a $500,000 house, you could save almost $160,000 on interest payments by switching from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage? Now, if you do this, the monthly payments will be a little bit higher, but at the end of the day, you could save hundreds of thousands of dollars that could be money going right back into your pocket.
