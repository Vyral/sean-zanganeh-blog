A major contingency I recommend to my buyers is the inspection contingency, also known as the due diligence period, where a professional inspector searches for any issues with the house. This is an important part of the home-buying process because it reveals the current condition of the property. Here are the three things an inspector typically checks:

**1\. Safety.** The home should be safe for you and your loved one. There shouldn’t be any trip hazards, electrical problems, or other potential issues that might affect your safety.

**2\. Structural.** The foundation of the home should be solid and able to stand the test of time. The inspector will usually check the condition of the roof and look for cracks in the walls.&nbsp;

**3\. Utilities.** The HVAC system and filtration systems will be inspected. They should be in good working order, and if they aren’t, you should find out how much it would cost to repair or replace them.

Take note of these three tips to make your home inspections go smoother. If you need more help with your home inspection, reach out by giving me a call or sending an email. I look forward to hearing from you\!
