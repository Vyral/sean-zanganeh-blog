As you might already know, spring starts quite a bit earlier in San Diego compared to other parts of the country. If you plan to sell your home this spring, these four steps will help you get the most out of your sale.

1. **Figure out how much your home is worth** by calling a professional real estate agent who sells homes in your area, and maybe even get a second opinion. You want to know exactly what your home's fair market value is and an approximate best time to sell it. An agent should also ask you questions about where you're moving to and when you want to move.
2. **Consider what you have to do to get the home ready for sale.** This could be as simple as decluttering your living room or putting some wood chips in the front yard, or all the way up to a light remodel. An agent will help you assess what the best move is to maximize your value.
3. **Find the right time to put your home on the market.** Two things come into play here. Since we have nice weather here, we always recommend listing right after the Super Bowl when the maximum amount of buyers come out of the woodwork. The second thing we look at is how many other homes are on the market in your neighborhood. Sometimes, timing your sale for right after a few homes close could be the difference in you getting an extra $5,000, $10,000, or even $15,000. We can help you measure that and assess the market to be ready to go.
4. **Figure out when and how to show the home.&nbsp;**This depends on whether you have kids and pets, your home's location, and the demographic of the buyers for your neighborhood. We always say that the easier it is to show a home, the easier it is to sell for top dollar in a faster amount of time. We can coach you on how to achieve this, too.
