Will home prices continue to increase, or will we fall into a recession? Today I want to briefly discuss the future of San Diego’s housing market.

In May 2022, the average home price in San Diego reached $1 million. What does this mean for sellers? First, **our market has had crazy-high appreciation recently, but things may calm down soon.** The market won’t crash, but instead of 25% appreciation, we may only see around 10%.

Second, pricing your property correctly is more important now than ever. The market is still ascending, but just because your neighbor sold for a certain amount doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed to get a little more. The market is moving at a slower pace, but smartly priced homes are still selling with multiple offers over list price. However, overpriced homes are sitting on the market longer than they would have a few months ago.

Meanwhile, interest rates continue to be the biggest factor in our market for buyers. If you became pre-approved a few months ago, I recommend you go through the process again. **Your rates have likely changed, and it could impact your buying power.** The last thing you want is to find your dream home only to learn you can’t afford it.

Overall, I think 2022 will be full of opportunities. It will likely be easier to buy and sell a home at the same time since there will be more inventory and less competition. Despite these factors, home prices won’t fall anytime soon. Even if inventory rises, it will still be very low. Instead of homes selling with 25 or 30 offers, they’ll sell with three or five, which is still good.
