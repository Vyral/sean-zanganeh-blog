Are you single and looking to find the right place to call home here in San Diego? We recently took a poll of single people in our community and asked them where were the most popular places for them to live, whether they're relocating within the city or from far away. Here are the top four places where single people live in San Diego:&nbsp;

**1\. Pacific Beach.** This is an extremely popular area, especially for younger people, as they tend to be drawn to the beautiful beaches with fun bars and great restaurants. Plus, there’s walkability and a great lifestyle. This location is the most popular on today’s list.&nbsp;

**2\. Little Italy.** This spot is so popular because it’s downtown where people can see the bars, nightclubs, restaurants, and everything going on. Plus, it’s close to the airport. This location has some of the best restaurants and events in San Diego, and it's very culturally diverse.&nbsp;

**3\. North Park.** This area has become that cool, hipster area, with some of the best coffee shops, breweries, and restaurants. It’s also more affordable compared to Pacific Beach and Little Italy, yet still just minutes from downtown and everything else people are looking for.&nbsp;

**4\. Encinitas.** People go here because they can find a young and vibrant feel, while also having upscale living. Also, once people try living in the Metro San Diego area, many tend to eventually relocate to Encinitas because it has a different lifestyle but is still only 30 minutes from downtown.&nbsp;

Those are the top four places that we find single people moving to in San Diego. If you have any questions or want more information about the San Diego area and its market, don't hesitate to reach out! You can call or email us anytime, and we’d be happy to hear from you.&nbsp;
