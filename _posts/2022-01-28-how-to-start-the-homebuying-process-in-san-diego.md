Are you interested in buying a home in San Diego, but you don’t know where to start? Today I’ll share a few tips and tricks on how to win in today’s real estate market.

First, we like to sit down with our buyers to find out about your needs. Do you have a family? Do you want to live in an urban setting? Are you looking for good schools? Are you looking for nightlife attractions? Do you love beaches? All these questions will help us find your dream home.

Similarly, **we need to know if you’ll need to commute for work.** Many people think that they’ll be fine living far away from their workplaces, but as we come out of the COVID era, the traffic is starting to return to San Diego. The location of the home makes a huge difference; one or two exits could add 15 to 20 minutes to your commute each way.

Next, **we’ll create a hot map** by looking up properties that sold over the last 60 days over the area you’re interested in to see if it’s a good fit for you and your family. Looking at homes that border the area you’re looking in is a good backup plan to help you get a better deal.

We recommend that you schedule a time to sit down with us to talk about the area. We’ll help you learn about the landmarks, shopping centers, restaurants, and bars where you’ll be moving so that you know what amenities you’ll be able to enjoy. We could also take you on a tour of the area or make you a map of the points of interest.

These are just a few of the things we suggest to clients who are moving to San Diego. If you’d like to hear more or if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.
