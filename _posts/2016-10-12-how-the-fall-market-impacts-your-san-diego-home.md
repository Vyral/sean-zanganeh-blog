Let's take a look at the fall market and what we can expect for the rest of the year.

I'm constantly asked if I think we're in a buyer's market or a seller's market, but I actually think it's a neutral market. What does that mean to you? If you're a buyer, you benefit from interest rates still being super low. **We're seeing buyers get great deals on properties**, and the opportunities for these deals will continue as we head into the winter months.

What about sellers? **Inventory is still tight in our market, meaning there are not a lot of homes for sale**. Sellers are getting multiple offers on properties, and we see a lot of energy around listings. This means that there are definitely buyers out there for homes. With interest rates as low as they are, many buyers are taking action.

It's going to be a wacky election year and a lot of things are going to change, but our local market shouldn't be affected much. We still have a lot of people who are looking to buy or sell, and a lot of people making smart real estate decisions are keeping our market moving forward.

If you're thinking of buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to work with you.
