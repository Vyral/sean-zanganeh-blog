&nbsp;

If you’re thinking of buying a home this year but aren’t sure whether the timing is right, this message will help you decide whether moving forward with a home search is right for you.

For one thing, the question of whether 2019 is a good year to buy a home doesn’t have a one-size-fits-all answer. It really depends on your personal circumstances. Therefore, understanding what’s happening in our market right now will definitely allow you to make an educated choice.

First, **there aren’t enough homes on our market today to satisfy the high buyer demand our sub-4% interest rates has generated**.

And as a result of this high demand, buyers have split into two general demographics: those looking for move-in ready properties and those willing to take a chance on fixer-uppers. What many buyers in the first category might not realize is that not all of these fixer-uppers are as shabby as they think. In fact, some have great potential that could easily be drawn out with just a few cosmetic upgrades.

But don’t let this scare you. Although buyers have come out in droves, prices haven’t shot up the way you might expect. Rather, they’ve remained fairly flat. This gives buyers a little bit of extra leverage and sellers a higher incentive to be open to negotiation.

**The bottom line is that now is the time to take advantage**. Rates are low, homes are affordable, and there are plenty of great properties available if you know where to look. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
