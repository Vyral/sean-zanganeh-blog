I get asked all the time by people if they should sell their home now or wait. People want to know when the right time to sell is, and it’s an important question to ask. Before we list a home on the market we take the time to ask sellers a few different questions to figure out what their goals are and whether it does make sense for them to sell now or wait until a later time. Here they are:

1. **Why are you moving?** Are you upgrading or downsizing? Moving closer inland or more toward the coast? It’s the first thing we ask.

2. **Do I have enough equity to sell?** We constantly do evaluations for our clients to be able to give them the best information possible. Like a financial advisor would give you updates on how your investments are doing, we will give you updates on how your home’s equity is doing so you always know what’s going on.&nbsp;

3. **Do interest rates have any effect on me selling?** They truly do. Rates went up a bit immediately after the election and we saw a recent announcement that says they are going to go up even more. Contact us and we can help you get to the next step of the process.

4. **What type of market is this?** It really depends on where your home is. We break down exactly where you stand based on your home’s location.
