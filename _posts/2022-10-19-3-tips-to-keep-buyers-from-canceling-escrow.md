Are you considering selling your home but worried the buyer might cancel escrow? Today, I wanted to give you the top ways to keep buyers from canceling escrow on your home so you can get to your next destination:

**1\. Properly prepare the property.** One of the things we like to do with every one of our listings is walk the property. This is to make sure that if there's anything that's really important that may cause a buyer to become skittish during the escrow process, we either call it out, address it, or make it very obvious.

**2\. Inform and disclose.** Things are wrong with every house. An inspector will come in and find something wrong with your house, regardless of how perfect you might think it is. If you don’t disclose issues upfront, buyers may become suspicious during the escrow process. You want to make sure you're as transparent and forthcoming as possible.

**3\. Find costs or solutions to any problems your home has.** If something’s wrong with the home, make sure you are either getting costs or solutions to that problem. Often, we’ll get the financial responsibility for the problem and share it with the buyer. It's usually less than what people think because buyers assume everything costs more to get fixed. It creates a lot more of a transparent process.
