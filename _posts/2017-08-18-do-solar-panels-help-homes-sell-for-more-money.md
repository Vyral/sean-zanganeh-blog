What should you know about solar panels before buying them yourself? We’ve got some tips to share with you today that may help you make your decision.

We aren’t experts in solar energy, but we are experts in real estate values and what solar energy systems do to them. **What we’ve noticed is that homes that are sold with solar systems tend to sell for more money**. This is only for solar systems that have been purchased, however.

**Solar energy systems that are leased have the opposite effect**. Homes can sell for as much as $100,000 less with leased solar systems than if they didn’t have a system at all. This is because most buyers are hesitant to pick up the extra costs. Although a leased solar system is cheaper in the short term, a purchased solar system has a much higher resale value.&nbsp;

Buyers are hesitant to pick up any extra fees, let alone the fees for a system they probably don’t know too much about. There’s just not as much education for people who are looking to lease solar panels today in the middle of a real estate transaction.

**If you are a homeowner already and looking at adding a solar energy system, think about how long you will be in the home**. If you’re going to be there longer than a few years, purchasing a system is your best investment.

We wanted to share those quick tips with you just in case you’ve been considering getting a solar energy system. If you have any other questions about these systems or about anything else related to real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to hear from you.
