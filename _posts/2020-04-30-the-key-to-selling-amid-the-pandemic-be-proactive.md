<br>Are homes still selling during the COVID-19 pandemic? If you need to sell, how do you even go about doing so right now? Truthfully, the market is still moving along considerably well. We’re monitoring the MLS and seeing homes in our San Diego market go into escrow every single day—remarkably close to what we’d see under normal conditions. Here’s even more good news: **If your home is in a low inventory area or a highly sought-after price point, we’re seeing those prices increase**.

The sellers getting top dollar for their homes right now are the ones working with experienced agents who leverage 3D Matterport tours and narrated video walk-throughs to keep prospective buyers well-informed and all parties safe.

Things like high-definition photography, professional videography, and virtual tours have always been powerful tools in the arsenal of elite modern brokerages; now more than ever, these tools are essential to the success of a real estate transaction. We have plenty of experience using various media to get homes maximum exposure on the market, so we’re well-equipped to handle this shift to virtual real estate processes.

What’s next? **Make sure you’re reaching out to a real estate agent and having the conversation now**. Buyer tastes and overall demand are changing right now, so the earlier you can prepare your home and set up a game plan for going to market, the better.

If you think you need help with getting your home sold in this unusual environment, please feel free to reach out to us today. We’d love to have a confidential conversation with you and explore your specific situation.
