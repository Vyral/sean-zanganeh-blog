There’s a common misconception about Keller Williams that we need to clear up—it’s not just a company for new agents. While Keller Williams does offer extensive training and resources for agents starting their real estate careers, it’s also a home for some of the most experienced professionals in the industry.

As Palmer Francis, Head of Growth at Keller Williams in Del Mar and Carmel Valley, points out, **Keller Williams has a well-balanced mix of both new agents and tenured professionals, including nationwide mega teams.** These mega teams are proof that seasoned agents can thrive within Keller Williams’ supportive environment, using the tools and systems provided to grow their businesses on a large scale.
