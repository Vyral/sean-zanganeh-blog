        "content": "Today we are joined by special guest Molly O’Dell of Oakwood Escrow, and we were so excited to have her join us. We talked about security, escrow, and what has changed in the last year.Email hacking is happening in every other industry and around the world, so why wouldn’t it happen in real estate? There is so much money going back and forth and these hackers are getting smart. They are watching the MLS, keeping an eye on pending transactions, then they hack the system and try to steal the buyer’s money via bogus wiring instructions. We’ve heard many horror stories about this kind of thing happening lately.If your escrow company isn’t savvy enough with their digital security, you could lose your money so easily as a buyer. Encrypted emails may be an extra step and a tad annoying, but it is really worth it. We have to encrypt our emails to make sure that our clients are safe.“We’ve seen too many buyers get scammed.”One other thing that Molly thinks is important is to stop emailing wiring instructions. It’s commonly known that this is how hackers have stolen a lot of money in the past few years. At Oakwood Escrow, Molly and her team do not send wiring instructions via email. They can send them over the phone, via fax, or text message. It’s a lot safer than doing it over email.If you have any questions about the escrow process in the meantime, you can give Molly a call at (619) 889-5639 or send an email to modell@oakwoodescrow.com.If you have any other real estate related questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are a lot of moving parts to every real estate transaction, and many people aren’t sure what happens during closing and escrow. Today, special guest Molly O’Dell from Oakwood Escrow is here to answer the three top escrow questions we get from our clients. 1. When is closing and what does that mean here in San Diego? The closing date is based off the contract that the Realtor gives to the escrow company. Closing usually takes 30 to 45 days, although Molly says that it can be shorter or longer. At closing, all of the documents are signed and approved by all parties in the transaction: the lender, the title company, the buyer, and the seller. “Closing usually takes 30 to 45 days.”2. As a seller, when will the money from your home sale hit your bank account? At closing, everything is sent to the title company within 24 hours, or the next business day. Your funds will probably hit your bank account the day after that, so you will get your money about 24 to 48 hours after closing the hold or file. 3. Why do you have to sign documents with your Realtor and then sign documents with the escrow company? Your escrow company is a neutral third party. Although you signed contracts with your real estate agent allowing the escrow company to be part of the transaction, you still have to sign new documents with the escrow company. According to Molly, you don’t want your agent to sign your escrow documents because the escrow company is supposed to be a completely neutral third party. An independent escrow company is very important to both buyers and sellers. An independent escrow company doesn’t have a hand in the buyer agent’s commission or the listing agent’s commission. There are some in-house escrow companies that are affiliated with real estate agents. If they are under the same roof and same name as a real estate agent, they will obviously have a preferred party in each transaction. Molly says that the value of an independent escrow company is that they are able to step back and help both sides equally. If you have any other questions for Molly, you can reach her at modell@oakwoodescrow.com or (619) 889-5639. As always, if you have any real estate questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!",

Conforming loan limits are up to $453,100 for single-family residents in San Diego. On high balance loan limits, we went up to $679,650.This is unbelievable because it means that when you’re looking at something in the $800,000 range and putting down 20%, you’ve got a great opportunity to get conforming interest rates. In the past, you’d have to go through the jumbo loan process.It also pertains to multi-units. Todd sees a lot of clients who own triplexes and were limited on how much cash they could pull out of those properties who can now pull cash out at much higher numbers than they could last year. Now they’re able to use that to buy more properties or pay down their mortgage on their personal residences. They can take advantage of both sides of the equation.On our end, with the mid-range, detached home prices in the mid-$700,000 price point in San Diego, being able to have this high loan balance lowers the amount that people are required to put down on a higher-priced home. People are able to get the home they want in the time they want at the rate that makes sense for them.“This is the biggest rise in loan limits that we’ve seen in a couple years.”Another cool aspect, according to Todd, is that these new limits also pertain to VA and FHA loans. It means that you have a 3.5%-down FHA program where you can basically buy a mid-range, detached home and get an incredible interest rate. With the VA loan, you can put 0% down. This could actually stimulate the marketrather than hurt it, as people are concerned about with the recent tax reform. It will help both first-time and experienced homebuyers.We are really excited to be able to help families in 2018.

        "content": "Today I’m happy to be joined by a special guest, Todd Pianin of RPM Mortgage, to have a discussion about millennial homebuyers in the San Diego market. Todd has some awesome lending tips that will help any millennial who is looking to buy their first home become competitive in the market.Many millennials grew up during the 2007 credit crisis. Therefore, a lot of them only deal with cash and don’t have credit cards. If you’re a millennial that doesn’t have a credit card but wants to buy a house, you should know that you’ll need to have at least three different cards in order to purchase one. It’s important that you start building your credit now, especially if homeownership is in your future plans.One other big problem we’ve run into with millennials is a lack of rental history. If you’re in a situation where you’re living with a friend and renting a room from them, you should ask to get added to the lease. If you’ve been out of college for a few years and don’t have any rental history, it’s pretty hard to get qualified for a mortgage.“Start building your credit now.”If you do have all of your ducks in a row, it gives you a huge advantage in the marketplace. Inventory is so tight now in San Diego and there’s talk of even less inventory in the future. By having good credit and a solid rental history, Todd and his team can issue you an advanced approval in order to get your fully approved (subject to appraisal, escrow, and title). This will allow you to close on a home in just 14 days, which is much quicker than the average buyer.If you’re ready to start the pre-approval process or you just have any questions about credit or mortgages in general, give Todd a call at (858) 775-8958 or send an email over to Tpianin@rpm-mtg.com. If you have any other questions for us about the San Diego real estate market, don’t hesitate to reach out anytime. We look forward to hearing from you soon!",

        "content": "Have you ever found yourself in the process of buying or selling a home only for something to go wrong?Whether this has ever happened to you or not, I would like to share some tips today on how to prevent a real estate transaction from falling apart. During any transaction, there are three main hurdles. Let’s take a look at what they are and how to overcome them:  The inspection. Sometimes, this is the point where a buyer may find something they dislike about the home and simply walk away. The issue they find may not even be all that significant. Still, it can be confusing to a seller to have this happen, especially if their home was receiving multiple offers. For this reason, I recommend that sellers get rid of as many of these small issues as they can ahead of time. Anything you can fix for under $100 could make a big difference. During a real estate transaction, preparation such as this is key.  Appraisals. Problems related to appraisals typically come up due to lack of preparation. To help combat that, my team and I like to accompany our client in meeting the appraiser on the property when entering escrow. The appraiser probably doesn’t know the neighborhood of the home as well as our client or we might. This additional step can really demonstrate the value of the property so that the home is more likely to appraise.  The loan. Too many buyers out there aren’t truly pre-approved. When we have a buyer open escrow with us on our listings, we cross-qualify them with our lender just to be sure. This prevents people from spending a lot of money on a transaction only to realize they aren’t qualified to buy a home.“During a real estate transaction, preparation is key.”If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Who you work with really does matter. You need to be working with a busy agent or team who is in touch with the current market. My team and I are always dedicated to searching out and following up on deals. When you work with us, we can offer you valuable inside knowledge on how to secure a property. 2. Find an agent that is constantly working to find new properties. Professionals who keep a constant eye on the market are going to help you immensely when it comes to finding the right home. Your chances will be even better if an agent can bring you a property that few people know about yet. The less competition a home sees, the better your chances are. 3. Make sure you find out about off-market properties. Don’t forget to check out properties that were listed a few years ago and have been recently relisted.

        "content": "There are five reasons why the holiday season is a great time to sell your home. 1. People who look for homes during this time are serious buyers. They’re looking to close before the end of the year or the early part of January. If there are fewer homes on the market and you’re looking at the competition, you have to make a decision. 2. The supply of homes decreases. Fewer and fewer homes come on the market toward the end of the year because people who tested the market earlier in the year usually decide to pull their homes off the MLS and wait until next year. That leaves only serious sellers looking to make a deal and move before the end of the year. 3. People may need to move for tax and timing reasons. A lot of folks may be 1031-ing out of a particular property or need to close before the end of the year for tax reasons. These people are likely to make a decision, close fast, and make it easy for you as a seller to move or potentially rent back until the beginning of next year so it doesn’t interrupt your holiday schedule. 4. By selling your home now, you can become a non-contingent buyer in the spring. 5. Your home shows better during the holidays. You’ll likely have friends and family visiting you sometime, so you’ll probably do a little extra cleaning and decorating anyway to make sure your home is spic and span. “Buyers are far more serious this time of year.”If you have any more questions about selling your home in the fall or you’re curious about our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "I’ve put together some tips and tricks regarding buying a second home in San Diego, specifically some tax considerations you should talk over with your CPA if you’re thinking about buying a second home in the San Diego area.  Mortgage interest deduction: Here in San Diego, you can write off the mortgage interest on your property for up to a million dollars. That can get you a great place near the beach, downtown, up in Carlsbad, or a ranch property somewhere in San Diego.  Writing off your property taxes: You can write off all your property taxes without a limit. There is a caveat, however. If your annual income puts you in a tax bracket over $311,000, there are limits to how much you can write off, so make sure you talk with your CPA about how much of a write off you are allowed.  Renting out your second property: Did you know you can rent out your San Diego property for up to 14 days and not pay any taxes on that income? That means your second property can become a source of tax-free income over holiday weekends like the Fourth of July, or over winter break when a lot the snowbirds are coming down to San Diego to catch some sunshine. It is possible to rent out your second property and have two or three months worth of your annual mortgage covered by the tax-free income from that 14 days of rental. It is important to remember that renting beyond 14 days a year makes that income taxable and can change the status of your second property to a rental property.  You can shift your primary residence: When it comes time to sell, you may consider making your second home in San Diego your primary residence. In doing so, a married couple can avoid paying up to $500,000 in capital-gains taxes.“It is possible to rent out your second property and have two to three months worth of your annual mortgage covered by the tax-free income from that 14 days of rental.”If you’re considering making that purchase of a second home here in San Diego, these are some subjects that could save you a lot of money and that you should definitely talk to a CPA about.

        "content": "There’s a lot to think about whenever you’re taking steps to purchase your next home. Of course, one of the first things to do is to sync up with a great real estate agent who’s really got your back.Even so, there are a couple of things you shouldn’t overlook in your transaction. Even with the help of an agent, you want to pay close attention to certain aspects, yourself.First, pay attention to the neighborhood. Typically speaking, you’ll visit properties with your real estate agent around a pretty consistent time of day. My team and I personally recommend revisiting any property you’re interested in at different times, to get a true feel for the community and know exactly what you’re getting.Next, ask yourself what your commute will be like. Your lifestyle should be a key consideration in your decision on whether to buy a certain home.Whether you want to be close to work, to school, to family, or to a lot of restaurants, it’s important to know how far you’re going to need to travel.Also, be sure to look into the rules of the community. A lot of communities in our area have homeowners associations or CC&amp;Rs (Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions) that may impact things like the colors you can paint your home, what you can park in front of your house, and what kinds of pets are allowed.“Make sure a property matches your long-term goals.”Another thing people sometimes forget is to critically consider the bedroom-to-bathroom ratio. Think realistically about how much space you and your family are going to need.Even something that may work for you now may not work in the future if you plan on growing your family. Before deciding on a home, really think about what makes sense for you.You should also make sure to change your HVAC systems. A lot of property in San Diego has septic systems, solar systems, wells, and other features. Look into what maintenance is going to cost you.Another question to ask yourself is if you’re okay with features that can’t be changed. Things like location, lot size, and the floor plan are all features you’re going to have to live with for however long you stay.Make sure you’re happy with them.Also think about your resale value. You need to have a clear understanding of what it costs to own the home, what the home’s potential value is, and what rents are going for in the neighborhood in case you ever decide to rent the property out.Finally, decide if a given property will realistically be sufficient for you and your family’s growth in a long-term sense. Depending on how long you want to stay on a property, you really need to think about this factor. My team and I often see people try to squeeze into a home that is too small, simply because it fits their budget.Don’t make this same mistake. Make sure a property matches your long-term goals.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "I’m back with some more tips and tricks to help you win in the San Diego real estate market. Whether you’re thinking of selling your home soon or just looking to increase its value, there are a number of home repairs that you definitely should not put off when they are needed. Here are nine of them to keep an eye on:1. Caulking around areas where there may be exposed water. This includes bathrooms, kitchens, windows, and anywhere else where water can penetrate. We had a home on the market that didn’t pay attention to this and it ended up costing the owners $10,000 to fix the kitchen when it flooded. It’s much easier to buy a $10 caulking gun at the hardware store.2. Cleaning your dryer vent. So many people forget to do this. You should have it cleaned at least once a year to prevent a fire hazard.3. Roof repairs. With sun and water constantly hitting our roofs in San Diego, they can get eaten up pretty quickly. Any time you find a roof leak or imperfection, call a roofer. It’s better to spend a few hundred now than a few thousand later.4. Chimney sweep. For a few hundred bucks, there are plenty of companies out there that will come out and do a full sweep of all your chimneys to further reduce fire hazards.5. Change your HVAC filters. When people don’t change their filters for months or even years, they get clogged and bog down the system. That can cause it to burn out. Get these filters changed often.6. Pest problems. Whether it’s termites, rodents, or other pests, you want to handle any pest problems very early on. It can get very expensive if you don’t.7. Fix any plumbing leaks as soon as you find them. This is one of the more costly repairs that we see. A simple leaky pipe can cause major damage if not handled properly.8. Peeling paint. If you see any chipped, cracked, or peeling paint, throw a fresh coat on top. 9. Drainage problems. We see this a lot in homes with plants or sprinklers near the house. The stucco next to the house tends to get eaten away quite quickly. If that’s the case for you, it’s time to change to a drip system to make your home ready for the next time we get a big winter rain.“Pests need to be dealt with immediately.”These are just a few things that you should stay on top of as a homeowner, whether you’re thinking of selling soon or not.

        "content": "Each year, we sell many homes to many great clients, and 90 days to six months later, we hear about something breaking in their house—usually a major appliance.To avoid this situation, here are 9 tips and tricks you can use to extend the life of your home’s appliances and improve their performance.  Keep your refrigerator and freezer clean. Change the filters, make sure calcium doesn’t build up inside the tubing, and empty the ice trays.  Defrost your freezer. So many of us have items that have been in our freezer for many months, so throw that stuff out and remove the frost so your freezer isn’t working so hard to produce ice.  Scrub the bottom of your oven. When you have an oven, crumbs and other food particles tend to accumulate at the bottom. Don’t set tin foil down to remedy this—that’s bad for your oven. Instead, use a little elbow grease and scrub that part of your oven down.  Replace any filters in your AC unit or any other appliance that has filters. As filters get clogged, their machines have to work harder to pass air and energy through them, which can lead to them breaking down sooner. Whether it’s an HVAC unit or a water filtration system, not replacing their filters can cost you thousands of dollars.  Use detergent instead of soap in your dishwasher. Use only the types of goods that are prescribed by your appliance for that appliance.  Scrape your dishes before putting them in your dishwasher. Don’t just throw all of them in there without scraping off the gunk and grime first.  Don’t overload your washer or dryer. They each have a capacity, so if you’re washing and drying a lot of clothes on a regular basis, buy a new washer and dryer. If you overload them, they have to work a lot harder, and they can be very expensive to fix and replace.  To improve your dryer’s circulation, make sure its exhaust system is cleaned once a year. People usually just pull the lint tray out and clean that, but a lot of lint can also get stuck in the tubing that leads to the exterior of the house, and many people invest in a boost fan to push that lint out.  Don’t pour stain remover into the washer or store any bottles like that on top of it. These bottles can get hot and melt while the washer is in use and spill all over the machine.“Not replacing your filters can cost you thousands of dollars.”If you have any questions about these tips and tricks or you’re looking to buy or sell a home in the San Diego area, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email.

        "content": "Recently, Airbnb came out with a study saying they contribute $420 million dollars to the local economy here in San Diego each year. That’s a big number, and we have a lot of clients asking us whether they should consider buying an Airbnb property or converting a property they already own into one. If you’re asking yourself the same thing, the answer depends on a few different factors.For example, the city of Del Mar recently changed the restrictions on how you can rent out your property—they limited the rental period to fewer than 30 days and lessened the number of times you can rent out your property to four times per year. For decades, coastal cities have thrived off residents renting out their homes during the summer while they vacationed or traveled elsewhere. This means people visiting these coastal cities who couldn’t necessarily afford a hotel or were looking to bring their whole family along are getting squeezed out of the local market.So, is it still worthwhile to buy an Airbnb property?Our investor clients are still making lots of money off these properties, they’re super happy with them, and they’re calling us daily looking for more properties to use for this purpose. “Our investor clients are still making lots of money off Airbnb properties.”To find a good Airbnb property, the first thing you want to examine is whether there is demand for hotel stays in your area. If your community doesn’t have a lot of hotel options and many people travel to it, look into those demographics. Next, consider your budget and whether it’s even worth buying an Airbnb property in your area. Also, weigh your time commitment. The biggest management issue we’ve seen with clients is deciding whether they should do it themselves or hire a management company. When advising our clients on these matters, we break it down to the very basics of buying a rental property—does the rent in the area cover the cost of owning that property and does it makes sense?There are a lot of reasons people buy property for Airbnb or VRBO purposes, but when we sell a client a property, we figure out if the property makes sense from an investment perspective. Once we align with our client’s goals for that perspective, then we talk about whether they should consider renting it out as an Airbnb property. If you’re looking for a property you’d like to rent out as an Airbnb or you already own a property you want to transfer into an Airbnb property, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

This is only for solar systems that have been purchased, however.Solar energy systems that are leased have the opposite effect. Homes can sell for as much as $100,000 less with leased solar systems than if they didn’t have a system at all. This is because most buyers are hesitant to pick up the extra costs. Although a leased solar system is cheaper in the short term, a purchased solar system has a much higher resale value. “Buyers are always hesitant to pick up extra fees.”Buyers are hesitant to pick up any extra fees, let alone the fees for a system they probably don’t know too much about.

Lending conditions haven’t eased up in the last five to seven years, so the homebuyers who have been approved are strong borrowers with great down payments. The market also continues to increase, and affordability is around 26%.  Historically speaking, when a market has a shift or correction, affordability is around the mid to high teens. “Our market still has room to grow, but we’re not sure by how much.”So, what does this mean to you?  Ultimately, our market still has quite a bit of room to grow, and we’re not sure how much room there is.  Home sellers can cash out on their equity and move into the dream home they’ve always wanted because they finally have the down payment.

        "content": "Are you looking to win the home you want in our current market? Here are a few statistics you can use that will help you do so.  The first stat, which is a leading indicator of the real estate market, is the number of new homes coming on the market. At the moment, the number of new homes coming on the market is down 28% compared to this time last year. This means you have almost 30% fewer options than you did last year.  The next stat we look at is homes going into escrow, or however many homes coming on the market that are actually selling right now. This number is almost unchanged from this time last year. Last year, there were 83 homes going into escrow; this year, there are 83 as well. This means if you’re out looking for homes, you will face a lot of competition.  The last stat we’ll examine is home prices and how they stack up this year compared to last year. On average, homes prices are up 6.4% from this time last year. “Use these numbers to present your best possible offer.” These numbers mean we’re in a very strong seller’s market. Homes are selling for all-time-high prices—even higher than the homes sold between 2004 and 2006. Any buyers out there looking for homes can expect to face stiff competition from other buyers. We’re seeing many make multiple offers on different homes before finding the one they want.  As a buyer, you must be mindful of this information and do your research on the areas that are most important to you. Use these tactics to present the best possible offer and make sure you have a good agent writing that offer. That’s the best way to find the home you want in our market.  If you have any more questions about our market or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help.",

The first is a VA loan, which is a loan for active and former military servicemen and women. This loan gives back to those who defend our freedom by offering them a 0% down loan on amounts over $600,000.The next product is the FHA loan. This loan is backed by the government and allows the buyer to purchase a home with just 3.5% down here in San Diego. This loan opens a lot of doors to traditional first-time homebuyers. You can get a great rate, get into the home you want, and start building equity.“FHA loans are backed by the government.”Finally, you have some conventional hybrid programs. One example is the 80-10-10, which lets you buy a more expensive home by combining an 80% conventional loan with another 10% loan.To learn more about how you can buy a home today without investing much money up front, give us a call or send us an email.

They want to know if they should continue renting or just suck it up and buy a home.My initial response to them is that it depends. We’ve got to take a look at your goals, your income, and your debt, and everything else that goes along with buying a home.Generally, the average rental rate for a 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment is over $2,100 in San Diego. That’s a lot to be shelling out in rent.Right now, with that same $2,100 going toward a mortgage payment, you could get a 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom condo here in the city in the mid $400,000 price range and still keep the same monthly cost.“Buying isn’t for everybody.”Another benefit of buying a home is that you can capture back your interest rate deduction when you file your taxes each year.You can’t do that with rent.Buying isn’t for everybody, but we can walk you through the options to make sure you make a decision that best fits your lifestyle and your needs here in San Diego.If you have any questions for me or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, give me a call or send me an email.

We can help you create that list and then organize, box up, and move all your possessions.Next, look for that next house now. You need to know where you’re going before you put your home on the market so you have a good, realistic idea of what house you can get next. A good Realtor can help you clarify and list your living preferences and then show you a couple of homes that match up with them so you can get a taste of what your new lifestyle would be in your new neighborhood.Lastly, start prepping your home for sale.“Have a plan in place and know where you want to move next.”We have many instructional videos on this topic for your perusal, and we can also meet with you in person to help you implement an action plan. With the biggest move of your life being a downsizing move, you want to make sure you’re prepared and ready to take those next steps as efficiently and effectively as possible so you can enjoy the next phase of your life.If you’d like more downsizing tips or have any other real estate questions, feel free to give us a call or shoot us an email.

        "content": "I get asked all the time by people if they should sell their home now or wait. People want to know when the right time to sell is, and it’s an important question to ask. Before we list a home on the market we take the time to ask sellers a few different questions to figure out what their goals are and whether it does make sense for them to sell now or wait until a later time.  Why are you moving? Are you upgrading or downsizing? Moving closer inland or more toward the coast? It’s the first thing we ask.2. Do I have enough equity to sell? We constantly do evaluations for our clients to be able to give them the best information possible. Like a financial advisor would give you updates on how your investments are doing, we will give you updates on how your home’s equity is doing so you always know what’s going on.3. Do interest rates have any effect on me selling? They truly do. Rates went up a bit immediately after the election and we saw a recent announcement that says they are going to go up even more. Contact us and we can help you get to the next step of the process.4. What type of market is this? It really depends on where your home is.

        "content": "As you might already know, spring starts quite a bit earlier in San Diego compared to other parts of the country. If you plan to sell your home this spring, these four steps will help you get the most out of your sale.  Figure out how much your home is worth by calling a professional real estate agent who sells homes in your area, and maybe even get a second opinion. You want to know exactly what your home’s fair market value is and an approximate best time to sell it. An agent should also ask you questions about where you’re moving to and when you want to move.  Consider what you have to do to get the home ready for sale. This could be as simple as decluttering your living room or putting some wood chips in the front yard, or all the way up to a light remodel. An agent will help you assess what the best move is to maximize your value.  Find the right time to put your home on the market. Two things come into play here. Since we have nice weather here, we always recommend listing right after the Super Bowl when the maximum amount of buyers come out of the woodwork. The second thing we look at is how many other homes are on the market in your neighborhood. Sometimes, timing your sale for right after a few homes close could be the difference in you getting an extra $5,000, $10,000, or even $15,000. We can help you measure that and assess the market to be ready to go.  Figure out when and how to show the home. This depends on whether you have kids and pets, your home’s location, and the demographic of the buyers for your neighborhood. We always say that the easier it is to show a home, the easier it is to sell for top dollar in a faster amount of time. We can coach you on how to achieve this, too.“Preparing could be as easy as some fresh mulch in the front yard.”If there’s anything my team and I can do to help you, just give us a call or send us an email.

How can you make sure your offer gets accepted in a multiple offer situation? Use these three tips to ensure you end up with your dream home.  Do not underestimate the importance of your agent. You need to make sure your agent is in direct contact with the listing agent and knows what’s happening, what offers are coming in, and what price points the sellers are looking at. The more communication your agent has with the listing agent, the higher the probability that you’re going to get your offer accepted. The listing agent wants to know that you are easy to communicate with if they were to go into escrow with you and your agent.  Make sure you send something personal. Something like a letter or a short video is going to make you look like a more appealing buyer, rather than just giving them a number, an offer, and an email. Send something that lets the seller know you’re human, and really let them know your story. They might end up having something in common with you, which could sway them in your direction.  Find out why they’re moving, and where they’re moving to. Get as much information as you possibly can about the sellers. They might have hot buttons, and the more you know, the more prepared you can be to make a personal plea to go with your offer.“Make sure you end up with your dream home”If you have any further questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

If you remove them before you sell, it makes things less cluttered and simpler for the buyers, allowing them to focus on the space itself. If you have any extra furniture that is out of place, consider storing it in your garage or a storage unit.  Depersonalization. Take the magnets off the fridge and the family photos off the wall. We want your home to feel as neutral as possible for buyers.  Make noticeable repairs. If something obviously needs to be fixed, get it taken care of whether it’s a bad doorbell, a front door, or a light bulb.

        "category": "",
        "content": "I get asked all the time what sellers should do to get their homes ready for the market. While there are many things that you should do, today, I want to share a few home renovations you should definitely avoid. First of all, wallpaper is out. Don’t add wallpaper to your home unless you’re in a very selective, custom home or we’ve had some designers come in. If that’s not the case, throwing up some Home Depot wallpaper is not the way to go. Secondly, keep the light fixtures simple. People don’t find a lot of value in extremely lavish light fixtures, especially in the middle price points. Instead of getting a lavish light fixture, stick with something clean and simple. The next thing to pay attention to is flooring. In high traffic areas, it’s common for older homes to have carpet in the hallway, living room, or dining room. Buyers do not want you to replace that flooring with more carpet. Instead, consider laminate flooring, inexpensive tile, or hardwood floors. There are a lot of entry level hardwoods that compete with carpet pricing that you could install in a day or two and will look amazing. Although you should paint your home, you should avoid bold colors. Stick to neutral paint colors instead. Bold reds, purples, and blues are a little too dark and a little too specific to most people’s tastes. Buyers want something a little more neutral and calming. “Stick to neutral, calming paint colors.”Finally, consider skipping the swimming pool. Today, there is a big debate about water conservation here in California and whether or not it’s smart to put in a pool. How do you pay for it? Is it on solar? As a result, a lot of buyers are more hesitant about having a private pool. In fact, most would be happy with a community pool, which a lot of neighborhoods already have. Avoid these home renovations and you will have a successful home sale. If you have any other questions about preparing your home for the market or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "It seems that home sellers keep making the same mistakes over and over in San Diego. We want you to be aware of these common mistakes so you avoid making them when it comes time to sell your home. Here are three big home selling mistakes to avoid:1. Incorrect pricing. Price is very important in San Diego, and we notice that when consumers see a home priced accurately, they will not only pay more, but they will take action quicker. We want to sell your home for top dollar in the shortest amount of time, so we always recommend pricing at the market value for the best results.2. Making your home hard to show. Some buyers may just be in town for a weekend or a few days and only have a limited time frame for when they can look at homes. We try to give our sellers as much advance notice as possible, but it’s also important that sellers be as flexible as they can while their home is on the market. A buyer might only have one opportunity to buy your home, so don’t send them away.3. Lack of marketing exposure. Sometimes sellers want to just test the market or be a “secret seller.” However, if you’re actively trying to sell your home, you need exposure. You have to get your home out there online, get it seen, and continue to promote it to buyers in the area.“Being a ‘secret seller’ won’t do you any good.”If you have any questions for us or need some more advice for getting your home sold, give us a call or send us an email.
